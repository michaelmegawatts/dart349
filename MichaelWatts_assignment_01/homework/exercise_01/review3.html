  <h3>DESIGN</h3>
    <p>I appreciate that the main scrolling page isn't filled with text but a simple amount to get you started. Color choices for each subject made sense in creating their own universe, but it takes away from the overall cohesion of the website.</p>

  <h3>USABILITY</h3>
    <p>My grandmother could definitely navigate through each page while being enchanted. I like that the return to home button is directly in the middle top of the page where your eyes look... grandmother approved! It’s simple and effective.</p>

  <h3>CONTENT</h3>
    <p>It’s very clear what the subject is, and the site guides us well through the subject matter, while not bombarding us. There are moments for reading and moments for watching video.</p>

  <h3>CREATIVITY</h3>
    <p>They use just the right amount of parallax scrolling, while adding a small touch of animated objects, like a hummingbird, quite realistic and adding to the dimensionality. I especially like that the lines of descriptive text under the thumbnail images spread vertically a little when you hover over them.</p>
