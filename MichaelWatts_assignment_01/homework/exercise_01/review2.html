  <h3>DESIGN</h3>
    <p>Crisp and stylish choice of all white font, black background, highlighted with bright lime accents. Allows you to focus on the interaction and the promotion of his work. Nice promotion rolling feed at the top and on the side.</p>

  <h3>USABILITY</h3>
    <p>Navigating the site flows well and has several unique touches in the scrolling and transitions that make the experience stand out from most sites. I love the green light that scans the page like a photocopier. The scrolling horizontally to the next page is a refreshing change to our instinct to go vertical. I did notice that it switches to vertical when you narrow the window, which is awesome.</p>

  <h3>CONTENT</h3>
    <p>Probably my favourite part is that I know exactly what he is offering, and he shares just the right amount of personal and project information to inform and not overwhelm. Visually itâ€™s all very well put together, sleek, and in a handsome fashion.</p>

  <h3>CREATIVITY</h3>
    <p>The website appears simple but it has a good dosage of complexity and creativity. The transitions and animated ball that interacts with the mouse is a neat feature, just not sure what purpose it serves other than demonstrating his knowledge. He does show his process for that, again showing that he has 3D design skills too. None of it overwhelms the experience but informs the visitor of what he has to offer.</p>
