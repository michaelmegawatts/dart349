  <h3>DESIGN</h3>
    <p>Animated text works well with the matching color palette in the page tabs. I also like that each page has its own color that tints the images until you hover over them to reveal the real colors.</p>

  <h3>USABILITY</h3>
    <p>My grandmother would get very lost as the landing page is a little overwhelming with a lot of movement. Although the animation is cute, it took me a while to be able to focus and figure out exactly what the site was. I had to read “Jack Winter’s home dedicated to animation” a few times to understand.</p>

  <h3>CONTENT</h3>
    <p>They have a lot of content and show a large amount of portfolio work, even too much. Perhaps a smaller amount could effectively represent the aesthetic and skill.</p>

  <h3>CREATIVITY</h3>
    <p>There is an attempt to be creative in how the layout is very different with each tab, revealing a new page with a different width, but I don’t buy it. All of this compresses the mass amount of information and images, making the site feel overwhelming and claustrophobic.</p>
